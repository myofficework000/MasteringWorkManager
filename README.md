# WorkManager Background Tasks in Android

This repository demonstrates how to implement reliable background task execution using **WorkManager**, a part of Android Jetpack. It showcases one-time work, periodic work, constraints, chaining tasks, retry policies, and LiveData integration.

## ðŸ§  Overview

WorkManager is the recommended solution for persistent and guaranteed background task execution in Android. It supports various scheduling mechanisms under the hood like `JobScheduler`, `AlarmManager`, and `FirebaseJobDispatcher`.

- One-time and Periodic task scheduling
- Constraints: WiFi, charging, battery not low, etc.
- Task chaining using `beginWith()` and `then()`
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- LiveData integration to observe work status
- Handles Doze Mode and App Standby gracefully
- Compatible with Android 6.0+ (API level 23+)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Add the following dependency to your app-level `build.gradle`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.0"
}
